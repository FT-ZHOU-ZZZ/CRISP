**CRISP** (Clinical-grade Robust Intraoperative Support for Pathology) is a universal foundation model designed for intraoperative frozen section analysis. Developed on over 100,000 frozen sections from eight medical centers, CRISP provides robust and generalizable diagnostic support across a wide range of tumor types, anatomical sites, and clinical scenarios.

## üìñ Overview
Intraoperative pathology plays a critical role in precision surgery, yet it faces challenges such as diagnostic complexity and limited high-quality frozen-section data. CRISP addresses these issues by leveraging a large-scale, multi-center frozen section dataset to deliver:

- **High diagnostic accuracy** across benign‚Äìmalignant discrimination, key intraoperative decision-making, and pan-cancer detection
- **Strong generalization** to unseen anatomical sites and rare cancers
- **Prospective clinical validation** with real-world impact on surgical decisions

In a prospective cohort of over 2,000 patients, CRISP informed surgical decisions in **92.6% of cases**, reduced diagnostic workload by **35%**, and improved micrometastasis detection with **87.5% accuracy**.

## ü™ß TODO
- [x] *Release manuscript*
- [x] *Release source code of downstream tasks*
- [x] *Release [model weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fr83wGydqFN80r5fTq1UL06vmL-xkw3F/view?usp=sharing) of CRISP*

## üöÄ Quick Start

CRISP require following dependencies:
- Python >= 3.13.5
- PyTorch >= 2.8.0
- timm >= 1.0.16
- torchvision >= 0.22.1
- peft >= 0.15.2
- numpy >= 2.2.6
- pillow >= 11.3.0

To utilize the CRISP model, you need to download the [model weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fr83wGydqFN80r5fTq1UL06vmL-xkw3F/view?usp=sharing) first. Then, the generalizable features for intraoperative pathology can be extracted as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from codes.feature_extraction.crisp import get_trans, get_model

# build model and transforms
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
ckpt_path = "YOUR_PATH_TO_MODEL/CRISP.pth"  # please download the model weights first
trans = get_trans()
model = get_model(device, ckpt_path)
# dummy input
img = Image.fromarray((np.random.rand(224, 224, 3) * 255).astype(np.uint8))
img = img.convert("RGB")
# feature extraction
img = trans(img).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
print('input image shape:', img.shape)
feature = model(img)
print('output feature shape:', feature.shape)
```

```shell
>>> input image shape: torch.Size([1, 3, 224, 224])
>>> output feature shape: torch.Size([1, 2560])
```

## üè• Key Features

- **Foundation Model Pretraining**: Trained on 50 million image patches from 25 anatomical sites
- **Multi-Task Support**: Supports nearly 100 diagnostic tasks including:
  - Benign vs. malignant classification
  - Intraoperative decision guidance
  - Pan-cancer detection
- **Multi-Center Robustness**: Validated across eight independent medical centers
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Designed to assist pathologists in real-time surgical workflows


## üéØ Clinical Impact

### Retrospective Evaluation
- **>15,000 slides** across ~100 diagnostic tasks
- Robust performance across diverse institutions, tumor types, and anatomical sites
- Effective generalization to previously unseen sites and rare cancers

### Prospective Validation
- **>2,000 patients** in real-world surgical workflows
- **92.6%** of cases directly informed surgical decisions
- **35% reduction** in diagnostic workload
- **87.5% accuracy** in micrometastasis detection
- Avoided **105 ancillary tests** through improved diagnostic accuracy
